Extract text seamlessly from images using **Python** and **Tesseract OCR**!  
This project allows you to convert scanned documents, photos, or any image containing text into **machine-readable text**, making it easier to process, search, and analyze.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📷 **Image-to-Text Conversion** – Extract text from images in multiple formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)  
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support** – Works with many languages supported by Tesseract  
- 🎯 **Accurate OCR** – Utilizes Tesseract for reliable optical character recognition  
- ⚡ **Easy to Use** – Simple command-line interface for quick execution  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)  
- pip (Python package manager)

---

### 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanpal02x/Text-Extraction.git
   cd Text-Extraction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure **Tesseract OCR** is installed and added to your system path.  
   - Windows: Add Tesseract installation path to your environment variables.  
   - Linux/macOS: Install via package manager (`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` on Ubuntu).

## ▶️ Usage

1. Place your input image(s) inside the project folder.  
2. Run the script:
